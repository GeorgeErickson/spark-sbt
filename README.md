## Running Spark on Scala Worksheet
An example to run Spark on Scala Worksheet is presented as [src/wordCount.sc](src/wordCount.sc).
A Scala worksheet template for Spark is also provided as [src/sparkWoksheet.template.sc](src/sparkWoksheet.template.sc).

The detail explanation of the Spark worksheet is available at
 http://sanori.github.io/2017/07/Running-Spark-on-Scala-Worksheet/.

## `sbt console` like `spark-shell`
In this project, `sbt console` works like as `spark-shell`.
You don't need to install Spark to use spark-shell if you are developing with [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/).

The first time to run `sbt console`, it may take several minutes or almost an hour due to download Spark modules.
